# Auralyte
An [XIVLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher) plugin for displaying customisable icon graphics to indicate game information similar to World of Warcraft's [WeakAuras](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-2).

The main benefit to this plugin over the stock user interface is the ability to consolidate information relevant to your combat rotation in a way that makes it easy to see everything at a glance.

Auras can currently display cooldowns, charges, buffs, with more planned for the future.
